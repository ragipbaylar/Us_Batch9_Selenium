What have we used so far for wait?
- Thread.sleep() -> It is a Java method (not Selenium method). It stops the code for the specified amount of time
no matter what.
Thread.sleep(5000) -> stops the code for 5 seconds. It just waits. There is no condition for it.

Avoid using it. Don't tell anyone you use it to make your code wait.

Waits in Selenium

1-) Page Load Timeout

        driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(15));
        // It waits until our computer downloads all necessary files from the server
        // If it cannot download them in specified time Selenium throws an exception
        // that means there is a problem with the server side

2-) Implicitly Wait

        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(15));
        // Waits until the browser translates all the document downloaded and converts them to html codes.
        // If it cannot convert them into HTML in specified time period Selenium throws an exception
        // that means your application is not compatible with the browser

3-) Explicitly Wait

        // It stops the code until a certain condition is met
        // Allows us to wait only for one specific element or specific condition

        WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
        wait.until(ExpectedConditions(Our Condition));

titleIs                         -> Waits until the title of the page becomes ...
titleContains                   ->
urlToBe                         -> Waits until the current url becomes ...
urlContains                     ->
visibilityOfElementLocated      -> Waits until the element with given locator is visible
invisibilityOfElementLocated    -> opposite of the previous
elementToBeClickable            -> waits until an element becomes clickable
elementToBeSelected             -> waits until an element becomes selected
textToBe                        -> waits until text of an element becomes ...
alertIsPresent                  -> waits until alert is present on the page
visibilityOfAllElements         -> waits until all the elements with the same locator are visible
                                    mostly used with driver.findElements()

numberOfElementsToBe            -> waits until number of elements that have the same locator to be a specific number
numberOfElementsToBeLessThan    -> waits until number of elements that have the same locator to be less than a specific number
numberOfElementsToBeMoreThan    -> waits until number of elements that have the same locator to be more than a specific number
